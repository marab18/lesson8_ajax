### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. AJAX allows client web pages to quickly interact and exchange data with a web server without reloading the entire page.
2. JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.  It is considered a lightweight data interchange format, a subset of JavaScript, and language independent.
3. XMLHttpRequest is an API that can be used by JavaScript and other scripting languages to transfer and manipulate XML data to and from a webserver using HTTP.
